**Throughout my life, I've had the opportunity to meet many people who have helped mold me into the person I am today. But there's one person who I know I couldn't live without and therefore is the most important person in my life. This person will do anything she can for me, gives me wonderful advice, and has taught me a lot about life.  She's been apart of my life since I was born, but I really needed her more as I approached my teenage years and withdrew from my mom. she understood that I needed her without ever saying it, and have helped change me for the better.**


My favorite hobby is basketball
