**Throughout my life, I've had the opportunity to meet many people who have helped mold me into the person I am today. But there's one person who I know I couldn't live without and therefore is the most important person in my life. This person will do anything she can for me, gives me wonderful advice, and has taught me a lot about life.  She's been apart of my life since I was born, but I really needed her more as I approached my teenage years and withdrew from my mom. she understood that I needed her without ever saying it, and have helped change me for the better.**


My favorite hobby is basketball Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
